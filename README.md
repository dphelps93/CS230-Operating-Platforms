# CS230-Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

   The Gaming Room client is a small game development company that wants to release their mobile game DRAW IT OR LOSE IT on multiple platforms. They requested a backend solution      that would allow for them to deploy their game on multiple operating systems and web browsers. They also requested documentation of the design of the system.

 What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

   I explained in detail the business constraints and technological constraints of the program. I detailed strengths and weaknesses in multiple operating systems. I also detailed    memory and storage management solutions that would help the game and application run faster.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

   The UML diagram helped when developing the code for the project. It detailed the relationships of classes. The classes detailed methods that were to be used allowing for clear    direction of code development. I also included a reason why the architecture should be ran on a serverless structure.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

   I would better define the memory management and storage management to include further definitions of the systems being used. I would also include a Linux recommendation into      the operating system solution. Many of the APIs and solutions work well with Linux systems.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

When developing the systems used, the user’s security and experience with the application needed to be a main thinking point. The REST API was used in order to create a system of least privilege. This would assign users to a role and require authentication and authorization in order to access the application. Speed was another consulting factor that was thought of for the application. Memory and storage systems were picked in order to access the game as fast as possible. The user wants to know they are safe and are having an enjoyable experience to continue the use of the application.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Approaching this design was met with a problem that was then broken down into smaller pieces. It was then that we can develop constraints and parameters that the program needs to follow and allow us to create a functional and secure program. This would be essential task in the future to help design and formulate future projects.
